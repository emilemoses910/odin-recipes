    <h1>Kashmiri Lamb - Alla Emile</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe has been with me for over 30 years; it was given to me by a Kashmiri guy I shared a house with when I was 17. This is his mum's family recipe. Kashmir's cuisine combines the area's fruits and nuts with the ingredients and the cooking style of the Moghuls. This rich stew makes a marvelous main dish. Serve it with hot steamed rice or crusty breads. This is lovely!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 dried red chile peppers (such as cayenne)</li>
            <li>3 long, green fresh chile peppers (such as Indian Jwala)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri garam masala</li>
            <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup dried unsweetened coconut</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 pounds lamb meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon saffron threads</li>
            <li>20 whole blanched almonds</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place red chiles, green chiles, cumin seeds, garam masala, ginger, garlic, grated coconut, and tomatoes into a blender; pulse several times to chop, then blend into a smooth paste.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
<li>Stir the spice paste into the onion and cook and stir until the oil separates from the mixture, about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in lamb pieces and salt. Cook, stirring frequently over medium-high heat, until the lamb pieces are browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix in yogurt, saffron, and blanched almonds until well combined.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the meat is tender and the gravy is thick, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>Garnish the curry with chopped cilantro before serving.</li>
